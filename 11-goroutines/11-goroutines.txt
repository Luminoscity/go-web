The race condition between the 3 functions f1 and f2 is that they both use the shared variable sharedI and they are both executing concurrently. The race condition occurs because both functions are using the shared variable and changing it's value without any regard to what the other function is doing. So the output of thie program is different every time you run it, depending on what order the two functions access and alter the shared variable.
